        <img src="images/limbo2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>LIMBO is a 2.1 Extreme Demon mega-collaboration hosted and published by MindCap, co-hosted by Djoxy and verified by BGram on 26 November 2022 after 109,490 attempts.[1] The level is designed in a 1.9 style with a mix of indigo, dark blue and red, similar to the last 25% of weoweoteo's Extreme Demon Marathon but more detailed. The theme is also similar to both Hinds' and Vlacc's parts in Cybernetic Crescent. It is made to be the hardest memory Demon without relying on visual interference while implementing unique gameplay mechanics.</p>

The message is implied to be directed to the player character, the reincarnated version of the scientist (coward) from the manager killed by EAM-17 (it).
